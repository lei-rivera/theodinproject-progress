# Hello!

This repository is basically to track my assignments and projects while doing the online course, The Odin Project.
I've decided to track it this way so that I have a neat little repository of all of my files, and so I can 
practice git while learning.

I've noted the assignments/projects below, the dates they were made/complete, and the completion time (if longer than a day).
The further you go, the better my skills get (hopefully).
You might find some funny stuff. You'll probably find boring stuff.

But at least I made stuff
